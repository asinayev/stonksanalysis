Determine if the following search result includes a NEW announcement about a {}  Answer 'yes' or 'no'.

For your response, also extract the following (except the quote, provide info if it is known even if it is not in the announcement):
- Company Full Name
- Stock Ticker Symbol
- Publication Date and Time
- If available, a short quote from the search result that supports your 'yes'/'no' determination.

1. Locate the title. If the title doesn't refer to the company at all, or has nothing to do with the announcement respond no (this is not a new program). 
2. Locate the publication time in the search result's snippet, body or metadata. It may appear in any format like 'days ago' or a datetime with timezoneÂ like '1999-07-01T23:21:10-5:00' or other. Reformat to YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM using military time (put 00:00 if no time is provided). Do not convert timezones, so if it says +3:00, that refers to the timezone and you can ignore that.
3. Read the rest of the announcement for the rest of the details. The announcement may include links to and snippets from PREVIOUS announcements toward the end of the body of the text. Ignore these and only look at the text for this announcement.

If any of these details cannot be determined, use "UNKNOWN".

Respond in JSON format as shown in this example:
{{"newProgram":"No","companyName":"Microsoft Corporation","ticker":"MSFT","timePublished":"2024-08-12 15:30","quote":"In June, the board announced plans for a new shareholder incentive..."}}
